	abstract = {Through the work of constructing a field site, researchers define the objects and subjects of their research. This article explores a variety of strategies devised by researchers to map social research onto spatial terrain. Virtual networked field sites are among the recent approaches that are challenging conventional thinking about field-based research. The benefits and consequences of one particular configuration, the field site as a network that incorporates physical, virtual, and imagined spaces, will be explored in detail through a case study. The author focuses in particular on the logistical issues involved and practical steps to constructing such a field site. This article includes suggestions for ways of studying social phenomena that take place on a vast terrain from a stationary position.},

@article{Suchman1999,
abstract = {This article provides an overview of a research program developed over the past 20 years to explore relations between everyday practices and technology design and use. The studies highlighted reflect three interrelated lines of inquiry: (a) critical analyses of technical discourses and practices, (b) ethnographies of work and technologies-in-use, and (c) design interventions. Starting from the premise that technologies can be assessed only in their relations to the sites of their production and use, the authors reconstruct technologies as social practice. A central problem for the design of artifacts then becomes their relation to the environments of their intended use. Through ethnographies of the social world, the analyses focus on just how social/material specificities are assembled together to comprise our everyday experience.},

abstract = {Dans le mouvement d'extension de la port\'{e}e sociale du logiciel libre s'est constitu\'{e}e une utopie, qui constitue un pan de l'imaginaire politique contemporain. Cette utopie s'\'{e}tend d\'{e}sormais bien au-del\`{a} de son milieu socio-culturel d'origine (le milieu hacker), du fait des liens tiss\'{e}s entre " libristes " et d\'{e}fenseurs des " biens communs ", du poids croissant de l'approche open source, et \`{a} proportion de l'int\'{e}r\^{e}t suscit\'{e} par le logiciel libre chez certains intellectuels critiques \`{a} partir de la fin des ann\'{e}es 1990. Reprenant l'id\'{e}al cybern\'{e}tique de libre circulation de l'information, l'utopie du logiciel libre se pr\'{e}sente comme une contestation de la vision n\'{e}olib\'{e}rale de la propri\'{e}t\'{e} intellectuelle, et comme une critique des formes d'organisation du travail caract\'{e}ristiques du capitalisme industriel. Elle se d\'{e}ploie en tant qu'" utopie concr\`{e}te " (E. Bloch), mettant en jeu des pratiques de collaboration en ligne, des cr\'{e}ations juridiques originales, et des formes de militantisme. Elle embrasse un id\'{e}al d'auto-organisation de la soci\'{e}t\'{e} civile, fond\'{e} sur la valorisation d'un domaine d'activit\'{e}s sociales distinct tant de l'\'{E}tat que du march\'{e}. Elle est toutefois condamn\'{e}e \`{a} demeurer en de\c{c}\`{a} de cet id\'{e}al, et reste par ailleurs toujours menac\'{e}e par les s\'{e}ductions du mythe et les renoncements de l'id\'{e}ologie.},

His contributions as a founding father of social anthropology and his complex personality earned him international notoriety and near-mythical status. This book presents a portrait of Malinowski's early life, from his birth in Cracow to his departure from Australia in 1920. By the age of 36, Malinowski had already created the innovative fieldwork methods and techniques that would secure his intellectual legacy." "Young draws on an array of primary documents, including Malinowski's letters and unpublished diaries and manuscripts, and presents new information on the anthropologist's personality, private life, and early career. He describes Malinowski's restless life of travel - some of it in the imaginary footsteps of his literary hero and compatriot, Joseph Conrad - from Cracow to the Mediterranean and the Canary Island, Leipzig, London, Warsaw, Zakopane, Ceylon, Australia, colonial Papua, and the Trobriand Islands. Young also explores Malinowski's complicated relationships with women and with some of the greatest scholars of his generation."--Jacket.},

	abstract = {Suffering and Sentiment examines the cultural and personal experiences of chronic and acute pain sufferers in a richly described account of everyday beliefs, values, and practices on the island of Yap (Waqab), Federated States of Micronesia. C. Jason Throop provides a vivid sense of Yapese life as he explores the local systems of knowledge, morality, and practice that pertain to the experience and expression of pain. In so doing, Throop investigates the ways in which sensory experiences like pain can be given meaningful coherence in the context of an individual's culturally constituted existence. In addition to examining the extent to which local understandings of pain's characteristics are personalized by individual sufferers, the book sheds important new light on how pain is implicated in the fashioning of particular Yapese understandings of ethical subjectivity and right action.},
